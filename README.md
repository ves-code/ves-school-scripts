Installation scripts for
the [MARVEL-VES school](https://sites.google.com/site/vesschool2017/) in Lugano February 2017

# Scripts
Scripts to install on Ubuntu and other Linux the software needed
for the VES tutorial.

The _install-ves-tutorial.sh_ script will install
- PLUMED 2 with VES module
- Manual and VES tutorial
- VMD (64 bit version)
- LAMMPS patched with PLUMED 2
- GROMACS patched with PLUMED 2

If you have already VMD installed you can disable the VMD installation
by putting _INSTALL_VMD=NO_ in the script.

Requirements are to have at least git, c++ compiler, cmake, mpi library (e.g. openmpi).
See also Packages needed below

To install the software and tutorial you need to run the _install-ves-tutorial.sh_
script. Everything will be installed in a self-contained directory
that is by default _${HOME}/VES-Tutorial_. This can be changed by
changing the _INSTALL_DIR_ variable the script.


If you have a 32 bit system you will need to run _install-vmd-32bit.sh_
to install a 32 bit version of VMD.
